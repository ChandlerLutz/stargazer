stargazer - What's new?

This page summarizes the models, features, and bug fixes that were introduced in each release of stargazer. 

Please note that I am always looking for comments and suggestions. 
Do not hesitate to contact me at hlavac [at] fas.harvard.edu.

v. 3.0: 

- New models: 
-- clm (ordinal) 
-- clogit (survival) 
-- ergm (ergm) 
-- glmer (lme4) 
-- gls (nlme) 
-- lmer (lme4) 
-- lmrob (robustbase)
-- nlmer (lme4)
-- pmg (plm)
-- rlm (MASS)

- New features:
-- users can customize coefficients (argument coef), standard errors (se), test statistics (t), and p-values (p)
-- automatic calculation of z-scores and p-values when the user supplies custom standard errors (can be toggled using arguments t.auto and p.auto)
-- ability to set \label{} markers in TeX for each table (using argument label)
-- summary statistics table can now report logical (i.e., dummy, indicator) variables as if they had values of 0 (corresponding to FALSE) and 1 (TRUE). See argument summary.logical.
-- user can choose between rounding to a set number of decimal places (argument digits) and reporting all available decimal places (by setting digits equal to NA) 
-- can omit all test statistics 

- Fixed bugs: 
-- package runs much faster 
-- corrected p-values for polr() and zelig oprobit, ologit models 
-- coxph now, by default, reports robust standard errors, for consistency with its summary() output 
-- multinom models now report the first set of coefficients (when multiple sets are present), instead of producing an error
-- singularities in model estimation results no longer disrupt the output 
-- model formulas can now be symbols 
-- no more warnings when creating summary statistics tables 
-- minor formatting changes

v. 2.0.1: 

- Fixed bugs: 
-- stargazer now reports the correct number of observations for plm() models 

v. 2.0: 

- New models: 
-- betareg (betareg) 
-- hurdle (pscl) 
-- ivreg (AER) 
-- multinom (nnet) 
-- plm (plm) 
-- tobit (AER) 
-- zeroinfl (pscl) 
  
- New features: 
-- direct output of data frames into LaTeX (summary = FALSE) 
-- ability to omit the reporting of selected statistics (using argument omit.stat)
-- alignment of columns at the decimal mark (align = TRUE) 
-- automatic coordination of star cutoffs and values in regression table notes

- Fixed bugs: 
-- argument \digits now works properly 
-- \code{stargazer} updated to reflect, and work properly with, recent changes to Zelig
-- variable names can now contain dollar signs and underscores 
-- some minor formatting fixes
